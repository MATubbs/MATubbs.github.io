This is the repo for Chamblee Charter High School's Webmaster entry for TSA
Some features include:
  - Really snazzy music
  - Pretty much 2 websites in one (music site and TSA site)
  - 100% original design


### TO DO
  - Bug fixing (spacing on index)
  - Make sure hrefs are portable in cchs tsa the umlauts section is good(../index.php rather than /index.php)
  - Change <center> tag to something more modern in vex.html and shpe.html while still not breaking things
  - Find some way to align things to the left and right *in css* like we did before in cchs-tsa/index.html. Current solution is not valid (according to Nu)
.
